# Linux_networkstack_experiment
This project uses Proxmox VE to build a virtual environment. Since most physical networks are limited to 100â€“1000Mb, and CPU, memory, and OS performance exceed that, tuning parameters often shows little effect. Shrinking values may help, but the many variables involved make the experiment less objective.
